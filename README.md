## Gauteng Load Forecasting using a Hybrid Model for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average and Artificial Neural Network.

This project was inspired by an honors project I did in Statistics. The inspiration was the use of hybrid models in time series forecasting in order to accommodate various components and observe underlying patterns in data. Due to copyright law, please note that this is not the same project as honors as the dataset has been changed. The project makes use of hybrid models for classical statistics and machine learning models. The statistical part is ARIMA while the ML part is ANN. ANN is also widely used in deep learning models to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data, however, that is not in the scope of this project. Finally, hybrid models combine the two models and perform a single forecast. Based on the reviewed literature, the ARIMA model captures linear components of the data and ANN captures non-linear components. ANN achieves this by the use of non-linear activation functions; sigmoid, SoftMax, RELU, etc... In this project sigmoid activation function was used, this was motivated by similar studies conducted in a similar domain. The project  is structured in the following order:

- Data Wrangling & Exploratory Data Analysis.
  - Overview of Gauteng Electricity load time series data.
  - Decomposition of data.
  - Differencing data.
  - Train-Test Split.
- Model Fitting
  - ARIMA Model.
  - ANN Model.
  - ARIMA+ANN Model (Hybrid) 
- Summary of Results.
- Recommendations and Conclusion.

Important Note: If you not familiar with R, you can focus on "presentation.pdf" as it complied version of the R markdown with no issues.

You may now proceed to the project, Enjoy...

Thank you.
